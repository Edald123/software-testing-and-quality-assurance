## Req 1. 
Implement a set of classes in Python that
implements two abstractions:
1. Hotel
2. Reservation
3. Customers
## Req 2. 
Implement a set of methods to handle the
next persistent behaviors (stored in files):
1. Hotels

    - Modify Hotel Information
    - Reserve a Room
    - Cancel a Reservation

    - Delete a Customer
    - Display Customer Information
    - Modify Customer Information
3. Reservation
    - Create a Reservation (Customer,
    Hotel)
    - Cancel a Reservation
    - You are free to decide the attributes within each class that enable the required behavior.
## Req 3. 
Implement unit test cases to exercise the
methods in each class. Use the unittest module in
Python.
## Req 4. 
The code coverage for all unittests should
accumulate at least 85% of line coverage.
## Req 5. 
The program shall include the mechanism
to handle invalid data in the file. Errors should be
displayed in the console and the execution must
continue.
## Req 6. 
Be compliant with PEP8.
## Req 7. 
The source code must show no warnings
using Fleak and PyLint.
